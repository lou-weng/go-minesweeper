# go Project Setup

## Project Architecture
I used a combination of [go-standard conventions](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) and what I know of hex architecture.

## Makefile
I created a makefile to automate some commonly used commands such as build and run. This [resource](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/makefiles-for-go-developers/) proved to be helpful in setting up this process.
